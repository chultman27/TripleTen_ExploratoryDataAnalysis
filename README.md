# TripleTen_ExploratoryDataAnalysis

The objective of this project is to clean and analyze Instacart customer data in order to generate insights into their shopping habits. For each question addressed, a brief explanation of the results should be provided in a markdown cell within the Jupyter notebook.

The project requires the creation of plots that effectively communicate the findings. All plots should include clear titles, labeled axes, and legends where appropriate. Additionally, each plotting cell should end with a call to plt.show() to ensure proper rendering of the visualizations.
